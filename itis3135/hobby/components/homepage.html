<h2>What is Golf?</h2>
<p>Golf is a precision sport where players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in the fewest possible strokes. Unlike many sports, golf doesn’t have a standard playing field—each course has unique landscapes, hazards, and layouts that challenge players differently.</p>
<h3>Basic Rules of Golf</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Objective – Get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible.</li>
    <li>Scoring – The number of strokes per hole determines a player's score (lower is better).</li>
    <li>Equipment – Players use different clubs for different shots, from drivers for long distances to putters for short, precise strokes.</li>
    <li>Etiquette – Golf has unwritten rules about respect, such as letting faster players play through and avoiding distractions while others are taking a shot.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why Golf is Unique</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Unlike most sports, golf is played against the course, not just an opponent.</li>
    <li>Players of all skill levels can enjoy the game.</li>
    <li>It’s both a mental and physical challenge.</li>
</ul>
